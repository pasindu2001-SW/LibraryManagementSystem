# Library Management System

## Overview
The Library Management System is a software solution designed to simplify and optimize library operations. It serves both library administrators (staff) and members, offering features to manage books, user accounts, reservations, and loan processes.

   - Reserve books and cancel reservations.
   - Manage their personal profile and view borrowing history.

2. For Admins:
   - Add, update, and remove books from the catalog.
